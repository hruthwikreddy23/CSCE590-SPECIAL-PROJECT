# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

This project focuses on detecting fake news using a combination of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The system processes news article text, extracts relevant features, trains multiple classification models, and evaluates their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Fake news has become a major challenge in the digital era.  
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning methods to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake**.

The implementation includes:

- Text preprocessing  
- TF–IDF feature extraction  
- Classical ML models (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- LSTM-based Deep Learning classifier  
- Performance comparison of all models  
- Real-time prediction example
