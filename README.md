# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

This project focuses on detecting fake news using a combination of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The system processes news article text, extracts relevant features, trains multiple classification models, and evaluates their performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
