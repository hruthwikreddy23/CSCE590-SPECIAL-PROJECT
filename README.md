# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project detects fake news using machine learning (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and a deep learning LSTM model. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and contains both real and fake news articles.

## Dataset
Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

## Models Used
- Naïve Bayes  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- LSTM (Deep Learning)

## Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. TF-IDF feature extraction  
3. Training ML models  
4. Training LSTM model  
5. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices

## Model Accuracy
- Random Forest: **0.9982**  
- Logistic Regression: **0.9882**  
- Naïve Bayes: **0.9428**  
- LSTM: **0.6908**

## Notebook
All implementation steps can be found in the Google Colab notebook included in this repository.
